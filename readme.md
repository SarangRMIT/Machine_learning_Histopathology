The files included in this zip folder are Jupyter Notebook files. In order to run the two models, please 
ensure you have TensorFlow and Keras pre-installed in Anaconda. You will also need to install TesorFlow AddOns
to run the Cell Type Classification model.

To run the Cancer Classification Model, please ensure that you have two directories that have the cancerous and non-canerous 
images sorted into them. These folders should be put into a main folder named data to run the model. The Jupyter Notebook file
must be outside the data directory for this to run.
